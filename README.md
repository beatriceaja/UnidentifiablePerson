# UnidentifiablePerson

This code uses the matplotlib.animation module to create an animation of a anonymous person. It starts by importing the necessary modules. Then it creates a figure and an axis object using plt.subplots(). The initial position and size of the person are set, along with the dimensions of the different body parts (head, body, left leg, right leg), represented by circles and rectangles.

The body parts are added to the plot using ax.add_patch() to display them. The axis limits and aspect ratio are set to define the visible area of the plot.

The update() function is defined, which is responsible for updating the animation frame. In this case, it moves the person to the right by incrementing the x-position and updating the coordinates of the body parts accordingly.

The animation is created using animation.FuncAnimation(), specifying the figure, the update function, the number of frames, and the interval between frames.

Finally, the animation is displayed using plt.show(), showing the animation of the faceless person moving to the right.
